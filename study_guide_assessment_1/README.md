# Author, Librarian & Programmer: JS Assessment pre-test

## Overview

In front end web development, the programming language you will encounter most
often is JavaScript. Soon, we'll also use HTML and CSS to help a user interact
with our applications, however before we do that, we need to understand how to
use JavaScript to handle the logic of our applications.

In this project, you'll be gaining experience working with variables, primitive
data types, looping, arrays, and objects. As you work through the
iterations, be sure to take time to stop and refactor you solutions. There is
rarely one right way to solve a problem in programming, and part of your job
will be evaulating the trade offs between different approaches to solving a
problem.

## Learning goals

  - Understand what JavaScript primitives are, and how/when to use them
  - Understand how to declare variables and assign data to them
  - Practice using objects and arrays

## Setup

  - Fork this project to your own Github account
  - clone the repository to your local machine
  - `cd` into the project
  - run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies


## Iterations

  - In the src/ directory, you’ll find a file called ‘warm-up.js’. Read through the instructions in the file carefully. The exercises in this file will help you to complete the rest of the iterations. DO NOT MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ITERATION UNTIL THIS SECTION IS COMPLETE!!!

1. Complete the book tests

  - For the rest of the assessment, you will be working to build out some js functionality, using a test suite as your guide.
  - Start with the book.js file.
  - Unskip the first test in test/book-test.js
  - Run npm test test/book-test.js
  - Read the error messages CAREFULLY!
  - Make the test pass.
  - Ensure that all of the skips are removed from the test file when you push up to GitHub.
  - If you finish early take time to refactor your solutions. Is this the best approach to solving the problem? Is there a different way you could make the tests pass?
