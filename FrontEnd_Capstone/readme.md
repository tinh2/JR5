# Frontend capstone overview
## Overview
Hello engineers, congratulations on making it to the end of the first track of Justice Reskill. I know you all have worked very hard to make it this far and now is your opportunity to showcase all that you have learned in your 14 weeks. 

You will build out a solid frontend project with HTML, CSS and Javascript. The nature of this project is up to you. Try to build something that you are passionate about because you will one day be presenting this project to a future employer!

## Requirements
#### Carrying out CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) operations is a very common feature for most websites (like blogs, e-commerce, dashboards, and so on) so it's something you need to be accustomed to building as a front-end developer. A basic form of a CRUD application is a To-Do List or a Notes webpage. Having done one of these projects shows your skill with manipulating data structures. It's also a good opportunity to display your work with a frontend framework.
- You must use an external API. 
    - Your first step should be to find a cool API to retrieve data from, here is a [link](https://apilist.fun/) for free APIs that you can use. If for some reason you can not find a API to use that matches your project please speak to your instructor IMMEDIATELY!

- The site must be responsive
    - Please use Flexbox or Grid layout to make your site responsive. There are tutorials for both Flexbox and Grid on [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/)

    - Please use local storage to save your clients information
    - Note that you also have to create a logout button.
- Besides the login functionality you must think of some other way to make your site interactive.
    - Let users interact with your site like what you did with the (Care center app, rock paper scissors, Movie list).
- Use jQuery
- Please use code comments and good code hygiene.
