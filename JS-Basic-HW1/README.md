## Exercise
### Requirements

This homework will focus on the following skills:

* Create variables using var
* Using arithmetic operators to add, subtract, multiply, and divide
* Concatenate strings

### Instructions/Exercises

1. **Arithmetic Operation Exercises**
    * Add
        * Create two variables each storing number. Add them together to get the sum of the two numbers
    * Subtract
        * Create two variables each storing number. Subtract them together to get the difference of the two numbers
    * Divide
        * Create two variables each storing number. Divide them to get the quotient of the two numbers.

    * Multiplication
      *  Create two variables each storing number. Multiple them together to get the product of the two numbers

2. **String Concatenation**
    * Take two strings, “Hello” and “World” store each in their own variable and concatenate the two strings together. The result should be “Hello World”. Store the result in a new variable.
    * Create the following string “My favorite food is ____”. The blank will be filled in with your favorite food. Your favorite food, the string “My favorite food is”, and the final string need to each be stored in their own variable. The final result should return something like “My favorite food is dinosaur chicken nuggets”.
